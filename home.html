            <li>Grokster's software utilizes P2P architecture, making it nearly impossible to target end-users</li>
            <li>MGM <s>is not making enough money</s> feels its copyright is violated, so they sue Grokster since they can't keep suing end users</li>
            <li>The case makes its way to The Supreme Court, who rules Grokster <u>can</u> be held liable for the actions of its users</li>

					<p>The summaries as well as major progaganda movements of the era essentially make it out as though P2P technologies are bad and illegal. My primary focus was to analyze what aspects led to the Court's decision. To do so, I analyzed the rulings of this and two other cases.</p>

            <p>In the <em>Sony</em> case, The Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that Sony was not responsible for any illegal actions its users take using their Betamax Video Tape Recorders.</p>
            <br />
            <small>It's interesting to note that 2 Justices involved with this case were also involved with the <em>Grokster</em> case. Both Stevens and O'Connor sided with Sony and MGM in the respective cases.</small>
          </section>

          <section>
            <p>In the <em>Napster</em> case, The Northern District Court of California issued an injunction preventing them
              <blockquote cite="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/114/896/2343353/">
                from engaging in, or facilitating others in copying, downloading, uploading, transmitting, or distributing plaintiffs' copyrighted musical compositions and sound recordings, protected by either federal or state law, without express permission of the rights owner.
              </blockquote>
              <small>The case was appealed and the Circuit Court ordered a stay of the injunction.</small>

          <h3>Questions for Writers / Developers / Creators</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Is P2P the deciding factor in this case?</li>
            <li>What can we do to prevent ourselves from becoming responsible for the actions of our users?</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="fragments">
          <h3>Is P2P the Deciding Factor?</h3>
          <h3 style="color:red"  class="fragment">NO</h3>
          <p class="fragment">Much of The Court's decision is more closely tied to some of Grokster's business practices than the fact that they use P2P architecture.</p>
          <p class="fragment">By branding themselves as the new Nap<u>ster</u>, Grok<u>ster</u> sealed its own fate.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Additionally...</h3>
          <p>One of the other important differneces between <em>Sony</em> and <em>Grokser</em> case relates to the ability to monitor how users are using the content. While the technology wasn't available at the time of the <em>Sony</em> case, the <em>Grokster</em> case indicated that Grokster had information on its userbase that could have been used to prevent copyright infringement.</p>

        <section id="fragments">
          <h3>What Can We do?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Be aware of what information you know about your users.</li>
            <li class="fragment">Try not to be the reincarnation of a business found in court to be on the wrong side of the law.</li>
            <li class="fragment"><em>More importantly, don't advertise it if that's your only primary business model.</em></li>
            <li class="fragment">Look into operating your business in another country, or found your own independent nation on a <a href="https://www.privateislandsonline.com/search?availability=sale">private island!</a></li>
